## Unknown version

### Changed

### Fixed

## 1.2.28

First new release after a long time, that will prepare the refactoring to

* more functional api (no objects any more)
* clean API to be used by any client

The API is growing, and will at the end allow `pgn-viewer` to switch to the API methods. When that point is reached, I will eliminate the old `PgnReader`, and go to version 2.0.x then.

### Changed

* [#8](https://github.com/mliebelt/pgn-reader/issues/8) First additional API methods, not finished
* [#7](https://github.com/mliebelt/pgn-reader/issues/7) Switched from mocha, chai to uvu to speed-up tests

### Fixed

## 1.2.27

This release was done with the old setup, the issues match the issues in repository [pgn-viewer](https://github.com/mliebelt/pgn-viewer/issues) then.
