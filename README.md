# In a Nutshell

pgn-reader is the backend for pgn-viewer, and only used by it. It should be usable by itself to read and play through a game, though. It should at least be usable to perform some checks on a game read.

## How to Install

`npm install` to get all dependencies resolved. It has as dependency the parser `pgn-parser` which is separately published on NPM.

## How to Build and Test

* `npm build`: Creates a new bundle `lib/pgn.ts`.
* `npm test`: Runs the whole test suite to check the whole API.

## How to Use
